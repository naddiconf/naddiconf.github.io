# The Premier Data Documentation Conference

The North American Data Documentation Initiative Conference (NADDI) is an opportunity for those 
using metadata standards and those interested in learning more to come together and learn from 
each other. Modeled on the successful European DDI User Conference, NADDI is a three day event
with invited and contributed presentations, and should be of interest to both researchers and data 
professionals in the social sciences and other disciplines. A full day of training sessions 
precede the conference.
